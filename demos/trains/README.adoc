# Train Traffic Signal Identification

This demo is part of the larger _Stop the crazy train_ workshop, which covers a full-fledge solution with Edge computing, Kafka, Apache Camel, and Dev Spaces.


## Requirements

* Red{nbsp}OpenShift > 4.12.
* Red{nbsp}OpenShift AI(RHOAI){nbsp}2.8 installed on your cluster.
* Recommended: Worker nodes with GPUs to speed up model training.
* Custom workbench container images:
    - quay.io/jramcast/rhoai-ultralytics-workbench:8.2.60
    - https://quay.io/repository/demo-ai-edge-crazy-train/workbench:minimal

## Steps

1. In RHOAI, create the `trains` data science project.

2. Setup S3 storage in your project by logging in to OpenShift and applying the `_scenario_resources/minio.yaml` file.
Make sure you add this resource to the `trains` project.

3. Navigate to the `minio-ui` route, log in into Minio with the `minio` user and `minio123` password, and create these S3 buckets:

* `data`: to store the data set.
* `model-registry`: to store models.
* `pipelines`: to store pipeline artifacts.

4. Upload the `_scenario_resources/dataset.tar.gz` file to your `data` bucket.
This is to simulate an scenario where a peer data engineer stores the dataset in an S3 bucket, ready to be used by data scientists.

5. Upload the `_scenario_resources/base_model.pt` file to your `data` bucket.
This is to simulate an scenario where a peer data engineer stores the dataset in an S3 bucket, ready to be used by data scientists.

6. Create three data connections.
Use the `minio-api` URL as the `Endpoint`.
Use the credentials that you defined in the Minio YAML (by default `minio` / `minio123`) as the access key and secret key, respectively.
Use `any` as the region.

a. `data`: to connect to the `data` bucket.
b. `pipelines`: to connect to the `pipelines` bucket.
c. `model-registry`: to connect to the `model-registry` bucket.


6. Create a pipeline server by using the `pipelines` data connection.

7. As an admin, import the `quay.io/demo-ai-edge-crazy-train/workbench:ultralytics` workbench.

8. Open the workbench.
In the JupyterLab UI, clone the https://github.com/jramcast/rhoai-tot repository.
Navigate to `rhoai-tot/demos/trains`.
